    Microchip 8bit PWM calculator.
    ------------------------------
    Use this to calculate 8bit Pic's PWM period, freuency,
    PR2 register, PWM resolution by spliting the 10bit resolution
    to the 2 lsb bits going on CCP1CON<DC1B1:DC1B0> register
    and the rest 8 msb bits on CCPR1L.
    Formulas that have been used:
              1
    TOSC = -------
            FOSC

    PWM period =[(PR2+1)] * 4 * TOSC (TMR2 prescaler value)
   
                 log[4(PR2 + 1)]
    Resolution = --------------
                     log(2) 
    
            (PWM period)
    PR2  = -----------------
          (4* TOSC * TMR2)-1

                   (FOSC)
    PR2 = ------------------------
           (4* TMR2 * PWM Freq)-1

    CCPRL1_CCP1CON = (4*(PR2+1)*(duty_cycle/100.0))

    This is for a small range of PIC's family. Tested on 12F615/617
    enjoy!
